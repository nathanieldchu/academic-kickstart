## Where am I now?

I am a PhD student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow with [Eric Alm](http://almlab.mit.edu/index.html) in the [Department of Biological Engineering](https://be.mit.edu) at MIT. My [research projects](https://nathanieldchu.github.io/research/) touch a wide range of topics, but they all pivot around using high-throughput data, computational analysis, and principles from ecology and evolution to understand problems in human health.

* Can we treat or prevent diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease) by manipulating the gut microbiome---the bacteria, fungi, and viruses that live in our gut?
* Can we use metabolomics---high throughput measurements of thousands of molecules in blood or urine---to understand patient heterogeneity and inform clinical decisions?

Beyond human health, I also spend a lot of time thinking about sustainability and conservation. I devote much of my time outside of lab to personal growth through [alpinism](https://nathanieldchu.github.io/blog/) and [rock climbing](https://www.mountainproject.com/user/111841723/nd-chu).

## Where am I going?

In my next stage, I am pivoting from academia to entrepreneuship, in order to bring my research closer to the people or systems it benefits. Such a stage could take three forms:

1. A post-doc position aimed at proof-of-principle studies
2. Founding a company
3. Joining a small company

## Where am I from?

I grew up near Seattle, Washington in the shadow of Mount Ranier. I learned what I value and how to write from my mother. I learned how to be grateful for small moments from [my father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Lu). I learned how to eat Kraft mac and cheese with chopsticks from [my sister](https://www.instagram.com/meredithsarah22/). And I learned who I am at [YMCA Camp Orkila](https://www.seattleymca.org/camp-orkila).
