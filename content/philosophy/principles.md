I steer my life by two principles, from which come two corresponding goals.

## Principle #1: Life is rare, enjoy it

The probability that the unique physical, biochemical, and social events came together in the exact sequence to produce me is *unfathomably* small. Because of that rarity, **I am compelled to have a blast** during my jackpot chance to exist. Everything I do, I do becuase I want to. I love science. I love being outside. And boy do I love blueberries.

## Principle #2: The chance to live is worth sharing

The first principle naturally sets up the second, which is to work to enable other organisms---human or otherwise---to experience life as well. Such work might be environmental conservation, improving public health, or providing some small service to a worthy cause. Storybooks taught us to be heroes and make the world a better place. Why would you do anything else?
