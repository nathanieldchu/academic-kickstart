## Value time

Given the brevity of my existence, I want to make the most of every moment. Every second should be spent creating value, whether that value is to me, for society, or for the world. 

## Live thoughtfully 

I strive to analyze every action's inspiration, implementation, and consequence. Where do my biases come from? How does a decision fit into my goals? What behaviors must I change to better align with my values?

## Seek growth

Enjoying life optmizes two kinds of happiness: in-the-moment joy and life satisfaction. To achieve the latter, I seek learning opportunities that will fundamentally challenge my skills, my beliefs, and my confidence.

## Be open

Building relationships, developing ideas, and creating value are all accelerated by being open, which means both letting thoughts out and letting them in.
