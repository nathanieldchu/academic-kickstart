## <i class="fas fa-clock" style="color:hsl(209, 100%, 50%)"></i> Value time 

Given the brevity of life, I want to make the most of every moment. Every second should be spent creating value, whether that value is to me, others, or the world. 

## <i class="fas fa-brain" style="color:hsl(209, 100%, 50%)"></i> Live thoughtfully 

I strive to analyze every action's inspiration, implementation, and consequence. Always ask why. Then ask how can it be better?

## <i class="fas fa-seedling" style="color:hsl(209, 100%, 50%)"></i> Seek growth

Enjoying life optimizes two kinds of happiness: in-the-moment joy and life satisfaction. For the latter, I seek learning opportunities that fundamentally challenge my skills, beliefs, and confidence.

## <i class="fas fa-lock-open" style="color:hsl(209, 100%, 50%)"></i> Be open

Building relationships, developing ideas, and creating value are accelerated by being open, which means both letting the outside world in and letting the inside world out.
